Fizz Buzz is a classic interview question which interviewers ask pretty often. It is a pretty hard problem to solve, but once you figure out the trick to solve the problem, it becomes very easy. It is very important to know how to solve this question because it is designed to help filter out the 99% candidates who can‚Äôt seem to program the way out of an interview.

In this blog, I will show one way to solve this FizzBuzz question, but just know there might be various ways to solve this problem, but I will be showing the way I found easier for me and the one I recently used in an interview.

## The Question:

Write a program that console logs the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print ‚Äúfizz‚Äù instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ‚Äúfizzbuzz‚Äù.

## Planning:

Before starting to code the solution, it's important to plan how you're going to do so. So lets talk about what the problem actually is.

Let's write out the steps in a easier way to read.

- print 1..100
- print "Fizz" if divisible by 3
- print "Buzz" if divisible by 5
- print "FizzBuzz" if divisible by 3 and 5

We can see that we have 3 main conditions and when we have conditions we use a conditional statement, like 'if'. We can represent this as a flowchart.

If you don't have the option of drawing a flow chart you can use pseudo code. That way you don't need to worry about syntax or boilerplates before you even know what you're going to do.

```txt
loop 100 times (i)
    if i / 3 & 5: print "FizzBuzz"
    if i / 3: print "Fizz"
    if i / 5: print "Buzz"
    else: print i
```

When you break the problem down like this into small problems it becomes so much simpler. This is called **Decomposition**.

Now that we having the planning all sorted, we can move on to actually coding the solution.

## Coding

During an interview they may let you choose a language to code in, other times the interviewer might make you use a certain language. The interview I had recently required this to be done in C#, so I'll do the same here.

First we'll need to create a loop that will iterate 100 times.

```cs
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {

}
```

As you're writing this code, it's important not to focus on getting it done quickly,but rather taking your time and make sure you fully understand your requirements before wasting your time writing a bunch of code you will have to correct later.

It's also really important to think out loud and explain your decisions
throughout the process of solving this, Even if what you're saying isn't totally correct, it's important for the interviewer to understand your
problem solving process. Saying something is almost always better then not saying anything at all.

<Warning type="info">
  Practice talking while you code. It may be strange the first few times you do
  it, but slowly overtime it will feel more natural. Follow the **ABC Rule**
  which means **Always be chatting**
</Warning>

Next you'll need to create a few conditional statements that will line up with the ones you created is pseudo code earlier.

The tricky thing about FizzBuzz is how to determine if a number is a multiple of another number. Luckily most languages have a **Modulo**, often referred to as the 'Remainder operator'. Instead of returning the result of the division, the modulo operation returns the whole number remainder. The modulus operator, written in most programming languages as % or mod.

Here's an example of how to use Modulo

```cs
    9 % 3 == 0
    // 9 divided by 3 equals 3, with a remainder of 0
    10 % 3 == 1
    // 10 divided by 3 equals 3, with a remainder of 1
    11 % 3 == 2
    // 11 divided by 3 equals 3, with a remainder of 2
```

```cs
    9 % 3 == 0
    // true
    10 % 3 == 0
    // false
```

This is pretty much is the line which is the trick to solving FizzBuzz problem.

Now inside of our loop we can check if a number is a multiple of 3 and if it say, we can print "Fizz"

```cs
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
    }
}
```

We're checking if the remainder is equal to 0, if it is we can print "Fizz".
Now we'll just need to check if the number is divisible by 5. However, since we have more then 1 condition, we'll need to use `if else`.

```cs
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
    }
    else if (i % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
    }
}
```

That 2/3 conditions we need to do sorted now. For the last we need to check if the number is both divisible by 3 and 5. To do this we can use `&&`. This will allow us to check both conditions and if true, print "FizzBuzz"

```cs
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
    }
    else if (i % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
    }
    else if (i % 3 == 0; && i % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("FizzBuzz");
    }
}
```

Once that is sorted, we just need to print the number in between. This is very simple.

```cs
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
{
    if (i % 3 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
    }
    else if (i % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
    }
    else if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("FizzBuzz");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
}
```

You may think that's all you need to do, if you run the code now you should get this output:

```shell
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
Fizz
16
17
...
```

This may look right at first glance. However, if you look at where the number 15 would be, it only says "Fizz", not "FizzBuzz". This is a common mistake that costs many people a job.

The issue is that our code is printing Fizz before it can get the chance to check if i is a multiple of both 3 and 5. Luckily it's an easy fix. Just make it the first condition to be checked.

```cs
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
{
    if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizzbuzz");
    }
    else if (i % 3 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizz");
    }
    else if (i % 5 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Buzz");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
}
```

Now if we run this code again, we should see that 15 now says 'FizzBuzz'

```shell
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
Fizzbuzz
16
17
...
```

## Congratulations! It works! ü•≥

That's it! If this helped then you let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jparw3).

## Bonus

If you want to take it 1 step further, instead of checking if i is a multiple of 3 and 5. Just check if i is a multiple of 15 as it's the lowest common multiple of 3 and 5.

```cs
if (i % 15 == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Fizzbuzz");
    }
```
