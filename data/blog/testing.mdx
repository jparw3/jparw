If you take accessibility seriously (you should), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) by [Modulz](https://modulz.app) is a really great library that takes care of all the hard things about building accessible components:

- Keyboard Navigation
- Focus management
- Screen reader support
- Typehead support
- RTL support
- etc..

## Styling Radix Primitives

Styling a primitive out of the box is super easy as all primitives accept className as a prop

```tsx
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

<AccordionPrimivite.Root className={styles.root}>
  â€¦
</AccordionPrimitive.Root>
```
